Request an Account
==================

To request an account for a project on Type 3 you should contact your local `Front Office <https://www.deic.dk/da/Front-Office>`__.

In the project application you have to specify:

- name of the project;
- amount of storage and core-hours;
- project collaborators.

After the project is approved and the account created, the user will be contacted by the SDU Back Office and will be asked to send an `SSH key <ssh-login.html>`__ for the login.
