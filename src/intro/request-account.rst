Request a project
==================

To request a project on the system you need to fill out a `project application`_ on `UCloud`_.

Once the application has been approved, you need to `invite`_ your collaborators to the project.

Projects of different origin
____________________________

Under certain circumstances, projects are created without a project application being filled out on UCloud.
In this case, you will be contacted directly by `Martin Lundquist Hansen`_.

They will invite you a project. After accepting this invite you will need to contact `them`_ again and request that they grant you PI privileges.
