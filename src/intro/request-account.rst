Request a project
==================

To request a project on the system you need to fill out a `project application`_ on `UCloud`_.

Once the application has been approved, you need to `invite`_ your collaborators to the project.

Externally created projects
------------------------------
In some cases projects are created without a project application being filled out on UCloud.
This will for example happen if you have been granted resources via a national DeiC project.
In this case the PI will be contacted directly via e-mail and on UCloud the PI will be invited to the project.
After accepting this invitation, the PI role of the project will be transferred.
